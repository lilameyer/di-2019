#### Potential project topics & questions

1. Crooked Media has done a few voter polls with Change Research about the 2020 election. I've found two datasets (one for Wisconsin, one for Arizona) that compare topline issues. How do these two states compare, priority-wise, or how do they compare to the rest of the country? 

2. How the generations compare (Boomer, Gen X, Gen Z, Millenial) in all every aspect - how do they differ most, and how are they surprisingly similar? 

3. The information learned from Apple's ScreenTime feature, now that it's on all laptops as well as phones. How do I, the people around me, and the more general population of Apple consumers divide our time? 

4. Voter registration data. I wan't to dispense with the idea of "my vote doesn't matter" when we live in a time of elections being won with a mere margin of hundreds. Perhaps take a few specific states (battleground?) and analyze how many people are registered, to what party, how many are actually active, and how many voters have been purged from voter years in recent years. Were there enough people to swing recent elections? 

5. This is very vague, but NYC is endlessly fascinating and I want to examine one of its social aspects. How the demographics have changed over time, why the subways haven't gotten fixed, how budgets are distributed as compared to other cities, etc. 

6. A timeline of the demographics in the US government (specifically the Senate or House of Reps... or both). How have the demographics changed over the last few years, and how do they differ by party lines? 

7. How do people use their cameras (on phones) now that they're so easily accesesible? What's the breakdown of pictures you wanted to take / ones taken to remember something you didn't want to write down / screenshots / memes / random things you don't remember how they got there? 

8. How do the financials of Broadway shows break down? How expensive are they to produce, how much are the actors paid, how much are average ticket costs, how many tix need to be sold to break even, how many people go to Broadway every day/week/month/year? This entire set could be compared to the financials of movies and/or TV. 

9. How do Netflix viewing habits change by any manner of factors - location, age, race, time of day, gender, etc. What shows are most universally popular, and which are very specific to one demographic or another? 

10. What can I learn about the people in my life based on arbitrary questions? Think: Dear Data project. I'm mostly interested in how people feel given the zeitgeist - are they happy, are they not, what makes them happy, what's missing from their life, and so on.
