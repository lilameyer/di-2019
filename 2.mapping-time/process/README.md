Description of the contents of this folder and the logic of your data â†’ retinal variables mapping.

My initial digital "paper" sketches; they're executed in the following pages

This sketch focuses on the retinal variable of value. Each circle is a different unit of time (hour, minute, and second) and the alpha value corresponds to the current value. So, the closer an hour gets to 12 or a minute/second get to 60, the darker the alpha value becomes. Rather than using military time, the user can tell the difference between AM and PM by the background color. If the time is between 12AM-11:59AM, the background will be white. If the time is between 12PM-11:59PM, the background will be black.

This sketch focuses on the retinal variable of shape. Again, each of the shapes corresponds to a different unit of time (hour, minute, and second) and the number of sides of the shape reflect the value.

This sketch focuses on the retinal variable of size. There are 3 overlapping circles, each a different unit of time, and each their own color. Their size (diameter) corresponds to the value of each unit.

This sketch uses concentric circles in a sketch that's most similar to a traditional clock. There are 24 lines on the outer ring, 60 on the next, and 60 on the center-most. The orientation corresponds to the value. The hue corresponds to the unit of time, with each hue belonging to one of the rings.
