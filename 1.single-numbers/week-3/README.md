## Nothing but a Number
#### Week 3

My posters focused on the same dataset as week 2 on college fight songs, but this time included the full raw data including explicitly labeling each school. The first and second posters are the same system, in two versions; the third is most abstract by showing only the number of times a cliché was used per school; the fourth uses arbitrary "puzzle" shapes to show the density of how many clichés were used for each individual school song. I focused on using the retinal variable of shape.
