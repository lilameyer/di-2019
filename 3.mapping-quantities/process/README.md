## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.


SKETCHES -- WEEK ONE 

// All Nuclear Activity

This clearly shows which countries did the most nuclear testing, both underground and atmospheric combined: The United States had by far the most, followed by Russia, the UK, France, and China. 

// Underground Nuclear Tests

 Again, this chart shows the United States did the most testing (particularly from the late 50's to the early 70's) with Russia close behind and occasionally overtaking. 

// United States v. Russia (1945-1963)

 This chart compares only the two most prolific nuclear countries to show which overtook which during the years of 1945 - 1963; The United States began higher, but Russia overtakes more and more throughout the years. 



 SKETHECS -- WEEK TWO

 // page 1

For each country, the left bar shows the number of nuclear tests conducted over the entire data set. The lightest (yellow) color is atmospheric, the middle (orange) is lab, and the darkest (red) is underground testing. The right bar is that countries spending on their military as a percent of their total GDP. It follows the same graph lines, but has different values; each line represents a step of either 100 tests or 5% of total GDP spending. 

 // page 2

This builds off a sketch from last week. The left tree graph shows how much each country contributed to total nuclear tests, and again, divided into the three locations of test. The right is the same format so you can compare how much each country tested versus how much money they spent. Here, the lighter areas in each country's block represents the % of GDP. 


 // page 

 This is the same logic as the previous page, just divided into 8 individual pieces for country. The darker color is the % of tests this country conducted as compared to all done, and an overlapping, lighter color of their % of GDP spent on average.
