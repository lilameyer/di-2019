## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.


SKETCHES -- WEEK ONE 

// All Nuclear Activity

This clearly shows which countries did the most nuclear testing, both underground and atmospheric combined: The United States had by far the most, followed by Russia, the UK, France, and China. 

// Underground Nuclear Tests

 Again, this chart shows the United States did the most testing (particularly from the late 50's to the early 70's) with Russia close behind and occasionally overtaking. 

// United States v. Russia (1945-1963)

 This chart compares only the two most prolific nuclear countries to show which overtook which during the years of 1945 - 1963; The United States began higher, but Russia overtakes more and more throughout the years. 



 SKETCHES -- WEEK TWO

 // page 1

For each country, the left bar shows the number of nuclear tests conducted over the entire data set. The lightest (yellow) color is atmospheric, the middle (orange) is lab, and the darkest (red) is underground testing. The right bar is that countries spending on their military as a percent of their total GDP. It follows the same graph lines, but has different values; each line represents a step of either 100 tests or 5% of total GDP spending.

This builds off a sketch from last week. The left tree graph shows how much each country contributed to total nuclear tests, and again, divided into the three locations of test. The right is the same format so you can compare how much each country tested versus how much money they spent. Here, the lighter areas in each country's block represents the % of GDP. 


 // page 3

 This is the same logic as the previous page, just divided into 8 individual pieces for country. The darker color is the % of tests this country conducted as compared to all done, and an overlapping, lighter color of their % of GDP spent on average. 







 SKETCHES -- WEEK THREE

 // page 1


Bubble Chart x timeline chart. The circles are the number of tests conducted by that country (diameter corresponds to #). The lightest shade of each country's assigned color is atmospheric testing, medium is lab, and darkest is underground tests. Underneath - the squares - is the % of GDP spent on military budget, again with the width corresponding to the percentage. (This is not filled in all the way, obviously - use your imagination!)

Bar graph approach. Rather than conflating the two datasets, they're seperated out here and, to further condense the data, are the averages of all data for each country instead of specifying by year. On left, for total testing: the lightest color is atmospheric, middle is lab, darkest is underground. On right, for money spent on military: light grey is total amount of money spent (in billions) and the black is the % of which was spent on the military.

For the sake of the graphic, this only focuses on the US data but can be applied to every country. The top graphic is the # and location of the nuclear tests - black is atmospheric, red is underground, blue is lab. The width corresponds to the # of tests (in a year). This is chronological but not necessarily a timeline as it doesnt leave blank spaces (or even spaces) for years with no data. It just goes sequentially with the info available. The bottom bar is the same logic, but the width is the % of GDP spent on the military.
