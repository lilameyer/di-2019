## Process

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.


// All Nuclear Activity

This clearly shows which countries did the most nuclear testing, both underground and atmospheric combined: The United States had by far the most, followed by Russia, the UK, France, and China. 

// Underground Nuclear Tests

 Again, this chart shows the United States did the most testing (particularly from the late 50's to the early 70's) with Russia close behind and occasionally overtaking. 

// United States v. Russia (1945-1963)

 This chart compares only the two most prolific nuclear countries to show which overtook which during the years of 1945 - 1963; The United States began higher, but Russia overtakes more and more throughout the years.
